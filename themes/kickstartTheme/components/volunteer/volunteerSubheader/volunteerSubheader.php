        Volunteering is not only about helping others out. In Kickstart Aalborg it is important for us that you feel as a small but an important member of our team. By volunteering you can explore what your field of interest is and broaden your knowledge as much as you want to.  We have also cosy team meetings and also our community manager looks out for having the best time of your lives,  not only professionally but personally as well,  while working with us.
